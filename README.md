This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError`. The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code which does not handle empty input lists and causes the ZeroDivisionError when `calculate_average` is called with an empty list. The solution is demonstrated in `bugSolution.py`.  The solution explicitly checks for an empty list and returns 0 to gracefully handle this edge case, preventing the error.
